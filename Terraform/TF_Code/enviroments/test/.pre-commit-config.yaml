# Best practices for maintaining this .pre-commit-config.yaml file :) 
#
# 1. Regularly update hook versions:
#    Run 'pre-commit autoupdate' periodically to ensure you're using the latest versions of each hook.
#
# 2. Test after updates:
#    After updating hook versions, run 'pre-commit run --all-files' to ensure all hooks still work as expected.
#
# 3. Document custom configurations:
#    If you add custom arguments or configurations to hooks, add comments explaining their purpose.
